# RubiksCube
An interactive Rubik's Cube and detailed tutorial to learn how to solve it.
These are the scripts used to run this project using Unity 5.
The main scripts for this project are Solver.cs and Tutorial.cs.
Solver.cs contains methods to perform an animated solution of the Rubik's Cube.
Tutorial.cs contains methods to display a detailed walkthrough to solve a Rubik's Cube.
The folder "Java Version" contains a Java version of a Rubik's Cube solver.
This simple version is not interactive and is incomplete.
A text representation of the Rubik's Cube is printed at each stage of the solution in a command line interface.
I used this version mainly to obtain and to test rotation sequences required to solve the Rubik's Cube.
